I'm a Master's graduate in Physics with Astrophysics, now working at the intersection of **data science**, **AI systems**, and **computational modelling**.  
I like building things that turn complex data into clear insights that impact the real world.

### What I'm working on
- **AI Data Analysis Assistant** – a LLM tool that takes any dataset as input and performs visualisation, ML baselines, and generates natural-language insights.
- **Energy Market Data Platform** – an automated ETL + forecasting pipeline using open energy and macroeconomic datasets.
- **Intelligent Routing System** – a GIS/ML project adapting medical emergency routing optimisation to UK traffic networks.

### Technical interests
- Applied machine learning  
- LLMs & prompt engineering  
- Data pipelines and orchestration  
- Geospatial analysis  
- Scientific computing & HPC

### Tools & Technologies
**Python**, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch/HuggingFace, Streamlit, FastAPI  
**SQL**, PostgreSQL, DuckDB  
Airflow / Prefect, Docker  
Matplotlib, Plotly, Folium, GeoPandas

### Current learning focus
- Building and deploying LLM-powered applications  
- Modern data engineering (orchestration, automation)  
- Geospatial modelling and routing algorithms  

### 📁 Featured Repositories
